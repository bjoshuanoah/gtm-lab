# GTM-LAB
An unofficial goTenna Mesh protocol playground

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the GTM Lab. This is a fun project to study and 
re-implement the goTenna Mesh protocols on inexpensive hardware based on the 
ESP32 MCU and RFM9x radio modules, using only unrestricted, publicly available 
information. All project code is open source under the [MIT license](/LICENSE).

The inspiration for the project was a message posted by user **dillon** 
on the goTenna community forum:
> put a goTenna assembly line in every home and letâ€™s see them fight this door-to-door

While the long-term goal of the project is a fully GTM interoperable open-source 
protocol stack running on open-source hardware, the short term goal is really just 
to have fun and share the lessons learned.

So, if protocol reverse-engineering and exploring the sub-GHz ISM band are 
your idea of fun too, grab a copy of the code and give it a spin!

## Development status
Full RX capability:
- channel hopping
- preamble and syncword detection
- control channel scanning with adjustable dwell time
- error correction
- control packet (SYNC/ACK) reception
- data packet reception and reassembly

**No TX capability** currently.

## Interop testing
The software is tested for interoperation with:
- itself
- goTenna Mesh, firmware 1.1.8

## Supported hardware
- **Easy:** out of the box, the code contains pre-defined configurations for two 
widely available consumer boards, selectable via the `BOARD_TYPE` line in the 
source file:
  - [Sparkfun WRL-15006](https://github.com/sparkfun/ESP32_LoRa_1Ch_Gateway)
  - [LILYGO t-beam 1.0](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-Beam) and newer

- **Medium:** any ESP32 board with an SPI-connected RFM9x or compatible radio 
should work, as long as the correct pin connections are configured in the 
source (using the existing definitions as an example)

- **Advanced:** RFM69-type radios should also work, but would require a rewrite 
of all register-specific code as the register numbers and layouts are 
different.

**NOTE:** LoRa functionality is NOT REQUIRED and NOT USED. 
The choice of a LoRa capable radio was purely circumstantial, 
due to its availability and front-end capabilities. However, the LoRa modem 
is disabled at startup and never used - the radio operates in "legacy" FSK 
mode.

## Installation
- Download the code (all files) from https://github.com/sybip/gtm-lab
- Edit the .ino file and change the `BOARD_TYPE` and `ISM_REGION` definitions 
to suit your environment
- Compile and upload to your board using Arduino 1.8+ with ESP32 1.0+ add-ons

You're ready to play!

### Dependencies
All required libraries are included, slightly modified from the original ones 
to support the (somewhat left-field) requirements of this project:
- [Arduino LoRa](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa) library 
modified to operate in non-LoRa mode, renamed to **LoRaX** to avoid a name conflict
- [Arduino RS-FEC](https://github.com/simonyipeter/Arduino-FEC) (Reed-Solomon) 
library was modded to support variable length messages and alternative FCRs, 
and renamed to **RS-mod-FCR**

## Operation
### Basic operation - packet logger
Connect to the board's USB port with a serial terminal at 115200bps.
Using your goTenna kit, generate some goTenna message traffic (ping, location 
tethering etc).
The messages should appear in the serial terminal:
```
I (6475353) GTMLAB: RX CCh=01 SYNC(1): chIDX=1, frags=2, iniTTL=3, curTTL=2
I (6475404) GTMLAB: RX DCh=42 DATA(2): len=90, fragIDX=0
I (6475436) GTMLAB: RX DCh=41 DATA(2): len=45, fragIDX=1
I (6475436) GTMLAB: complete: len=135, hash=0xcafe, time=88ms
RX_MSG:0302|003fff55555555555500ff0000fb100100......
```
### Radio protocol exploration
Change the VERBOSITY field to DEBUG or even VERBOSE to view details of 
received packets, correction protocols, channel hopping etc.

### Message formats exploration
The output lines prefixed with RX_ACK and RX_MSG contain full hex dumps of 
received radio traffic (see the source code for details on what some of those 
bytes mean).
These lines can be further processed on the computer using a Python or PERL 
script to study the format of the packets and extract useful information.

## Documentation and further info
All technical information relevant to this project is (or will be) published 
in the [pyGT project wiki](https://github.com/sybip/pyGT/wiki/), and of course 
everyone's welcome to share their findings if they want to.
